# php-form
A simple PHP mail form script.

I created this code because I couldn't find a PHP mail script that I was comfortable giving to my students to use on their websites.  My requirements:

1. Form should integrate a CAPTCHA service so that placing it on the website doesn't mean receiving a ton of spam.
2. Form should be safe from hijacking (ie, can only be used to send email to the site owner, not anybody else).

The use case for this script is that you should be able to take it, drop it into your website, change a couple of configuration variables, and be ready to go.

May add more features in the future.
